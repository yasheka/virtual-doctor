doctor at your door step


The" VIRTUAL DOCTOR" is a substitute to the local primary healthcare system. It acts as a charity at the intersection of technology 
and medicine. As it is hard for people who stay in remote areas to travel long distances and heavy travel expenditure, this application 
provides a faster way to detect health problems. It provides better healthcare at your fingertips. This acts as a medical consultant at
your doorstep. The software developed at the end of this project detects the disease affected to the user based on the symptoms given as
the input by the patient. The symptoms that are 60% matching with the diseases are displayed.The software also prescribes some of the 
medicines and gives precautions to treat the disease. The code is a prototype of actual virtual doctor software, which can be built by 
including more number of diseases.
The software is developed using simple c language with graphics for better presentation.
